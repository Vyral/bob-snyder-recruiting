<p>Dear Real Estate Agent:</p>

<p>I understand you’re doing between $2.5 million to $6 million in yearly sales, but you’re looking to achieve an even higher level of production.</p>

<p>Most often, agents struggle to break through due to a variety of factors, including:
<ul class="indent">
<li>A lack consistency in their business</li>
<li>A lack of coaching for complex deals</li>
<li>The inability to fund an effective listing marketing plan</li>
<li>They don’t generate enough leads on their own</li>
<li>They struggle with transactional paperwork and listing coordination</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Because of these factors, 87% of all new agents are out of the real estate business within 18 months. What’s the difference between these agents and the ones who stay? I’ll say this: Most successful agents are either on a team or leading a team, while most single agents have a hard time attracting listing clients.  </p>

<p>To solve this problem, these agents do things like signing up for expensive coaching programs or pay for leads via Zillow, Opt City, etc. However, this doesn’t keep them from staying up at 3 a.m. each night wondering where their next deal is coming from or how they’ll pay their bills. They know they can’t keep spending money on lead generation when they have no deal flow.</p>

<p>What happens if this problem goes unsolved? It’s very simple: They’ll have to join the 87%, leave the real estate business, and incur a variety of debt.</p>

<p>To help you avoid the same fate, I want to extend an offer to you to become a part of my team. </p>

<p>My name is Bob Snyder, and I am a top producing agent running a successful team of Realtors. We generate lots of leads and are on track to do over 200 transactions for the third consecutive year with no staff increase. And now, we are ready to grow! I have the knowledge to help you reduce costs and get you to the next level. </p>

<p>By joining my team, you’ll follow a new brokerage model that offers low expenses, low cap rates, and state-of-the-art technology and training.  </p>

<p>What makes our solution different from other brokerages is we are genuinely vested in your success. I’ll personally allocate time in my schedule to help you grow and I’ll be by your side every step of the way. Specifically, we will set up weekly accountability meetings, help you schedule your calendar, and assist you in generating leads and effectively managing your time. </p>

<p>After that, you’ll be integrated into our CRM so you can generate and cultivate your leads and contacts. Our training schedule features pertinent training materials to help drive you toward your goals.  </p>

<p>On top of that, we’ll provide you with a world-class marketing infrastructure for your listing opportunities and assist in coordinating your listing activities until your listing sells. Additionally, we’ll provide transaction coordination services to your clients so they’re well taken care of from purchase agreement signing to closing. This will allow you to focus on generating leads for your next transactions.  </p>

<p>All the while, you’ll receive agent mentorship from the top-producing agents so you can gain the knowledge and understand the work ethic of the most successful people in the business. As you work your way toward financial freedom, you’ll achieve your income goals and become a real player in the industry.</p>

<p>What are the alternatives to joining my team? Well, you could work for a mega-team structure and get leads with minimal training and a better split, but you won’t receive any team mentorship. You could also work for a low-cost brokerage to minimize cash flow, but you won’t get lead generation or receive any training. Or you can simply stay where you’re at.</p>

<p>If you join my team, though, you can join the ranks of our many success stories. One of our agents, for instance, was voted as RE/MAX’s Rookie of the Year. Another was able to lift their production from $3 million to $17 million. Another raised their average sale price from $225,000 to $367,000. We also have another agent who boosted their income level from $22,000 to $78,000 within a single year. </p>

<p>If you take me up on this offer, you’ll receive a 70/30 split with an $8,000 cap. Until your $8,000 cap is reached, eXp will take 20%. We pay all listing marketing expenses and pay you a 50/50 split on any leads we generate through our lead pool. Once you’re trained, you’ll get put into our team lead rotation.</p>

<p>Once you join, we’ll host an office happy hour to welcome you and introduce you to the team. After that, we’ll set an onboarding plan for the first 30 days so you can get familiar with our team and eXp Realty. During that time, I’ll spend one hour each day, four days a week with you. For the next 30 days, we’ll meet twice weekly for one hour, and we’ll keep meeting weekly until your production goals are achieved.</p>

<p>I’m so confident you’ll achieve your goals that I’ll offer to pay you $2,000 and cover your first 60 days of brokerage fees if you’re not tracking.  </p>

<p>If you don’t know where your next commission check is coming from, time is wasting for you to respond to this offer. Don’t hold off, or you may not be able to collect a commission check soon enough and fall into further debt. Reach out to me now and let’s have a conversation. </p>

<p>I look forward to hearing from you soon!</p>

<p>Bob Snyder </p>
